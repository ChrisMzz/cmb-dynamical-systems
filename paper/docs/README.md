# Study of H.T Banks' *Dynamic models for insect mortality due to exposure to insecticides*

The experiment begins with many pots, in which five broad bean plants were grown to a height of 25cm, and on which either water (control) or one of six concentrations of MO was sprayed.

The effects of MO on both neonate and adult pea aphids were studied in two separate procedures.
In both procedures, two clip cages with a young [apterous](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/A0A8R2F756/entry) (winged) female adult aphid were attached to the underside of the leaves of each of the plants in 21 pots (10 female aphids per pot).
